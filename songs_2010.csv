According to you
I'm boring, I'm moody
And you can't take me any place

2,Airplanes,"('B.o.B', 'Hayley Williams')",['Alex da Kid'],426084,6,2010,"[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro: B.o.B]
I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now

But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho

We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly

Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

'Cause everything is never as it seems

From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up

How come we don't say I love you enough?
Till it's to late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying

[Verse 2]
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll no one on the line, yeah

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes

You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Whoa, oh

[Bridge: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley]
I guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

[Chorus: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelley & Lady Antebellum]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now

I just need you now

59,Not Afraid,"('Eminem',)",['Boi-1da'],1427621,24,2010,"[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I’m so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

But you shouldn't worry
About what they say

I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither""

One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane

It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?

[Intro]
Kane is in the building

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse

This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you it’s catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow,  that's right
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade

[Chorus]
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

[Verse]
Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that

Sing like a bird

Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Right til the end
Oh

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Bridge]
Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Outro]
Oh, Lord
Have you ever tried sleepin' with a
Without my love
Have you ever tried, have you ever tried?"

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
Hey, you know, this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

[Chorus: Boys Like Girls & Taylor Swift]
Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
Yeah, yeah

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey (Hey, hey)

And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life

And I'm thinking, ooh, I can't live without you
'Cause, baby, two is better than one
There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
But I'll figure out with all that's said and done

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

Ready to give up on anybody that plays him

Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
