0,Ain't No Other Man,"('Christina Aguilera',)",['DJ Premier'],21742,32,2006,"[Intro]
Heeeeey! Yeah
(Do your thang, honey!)

[Verse 1]
I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Somethin' 'bout you caught my eye
Somethin' moved me deep inside
I don't know what you did boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

[Pre-Chorus]
Told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friends
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
That every time I see you, everything starts making sense
(Do your thang, honey!)

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true (alright)
Ain't no other man but you

[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd be alright (no, no, no)
'Till you came and changed my life (yeah, yeah, yeah)
What was cloudy now is clear (yeah, yeah)
You're the light that I need here
You got what I want boy, and I want it
So keep on giving it up

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell your mother, your brother, your sister and your friends
Tell the others, your lovers, better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine
And no one else's, woah, oh

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you

Break it down now!
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other (other)
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you
You are there when I'm a mess
You talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (next to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (oh yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
And now I'm telling you, so ain't no other man but you
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon (baby, baby, no)
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (don't you know?)

1,Bad Day,"('Daniel Powter',)","['Mitchell Froom', 'Jeff Dawson']",144462,1,2006,"[Verse 1]
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

[Verse 3]
Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know

And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie

You've seen what you're like
And how does it feel?
One more time
You had a bad day

Ooh ooh, ooh...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...

[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me, yeah yeah)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Yea, yea, yea, yea, I'm so icy
Charm so heavy that my neck don't like me

I'll throw my chain in the crowd like dang these (this is nothin')
Diamonds is nothin' to me
Especially when I'm dressin' up, its just a button to me (bling)
And not to mention my T's
Cuz they color coordinated, complimentin' the teeth (alright, thanx)
So check out my swag
Diamonds red, white, and blue like the American flag (its so colorful)
And see I got that nice cream
So much money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream
Give you a black eye cause of the beating
They think I am a mutant the way ya boy is beasting
I stay winning some time, you'll call it cheating
And my boys always around like it's a meeting

Is that ya chain?
Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride 'n' let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang
You know the name

Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us

Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you, babe
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

[Hook]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
I want to see your grill (You wanna see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom rows gold)

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do baby, it's the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

[Hook]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
[Ali]
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em, on the top, on the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
[Gipp]
I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry
[Ali]
I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold)

I can't believe you actually picked me.)

[Intro: Justin's Mother]
(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

[Verse 1]
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

[Hook]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Verse 2]
I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

[Hook]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Bridge]
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

[Hook]
Hate me today

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say ""sit down; it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain

37,"Jesus, Take The Wheel","('Carrie Underwood',)",['Mark Bright'],37284,78,2006,"[Verse 1]
She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

Oh, take it, take it from me

Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)

But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")

But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy

You know, I be thinking to myself
We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
We did everything together

Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)

Use to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days
(One wish, one wish, one wish)

(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
If I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good
(One wish)
One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish

[Intro]
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

[Verse 2]
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

[Bridge]
I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

[Hook]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor

Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could, I'd relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Good times let the bad times, and you ain't see it comin'
Tried the best to make her happy (happy), but it wasn't enough (it wasn't enough)
Cuz mama told me in relationships the road get rough (road get rough)
And I ain't the one to have my head down, weeping, stressed out
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next route (route), yes
I thought I was a man, guess she ain't understand
And now she sittin' thurr, lookin' crazy like ""damn""

[Hook: Tyrese]
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Say we gotta make it work"

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And ride with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twin's steady twistin' like, ""Hit this dough!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down, got to stop pollution
CD changes, niggas like, ""Who is that producin'?""

Got warrants in every city except Houston

Holy shit, ‘cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big old Excursion just swervin', all up in the curb'n
A nigga be sippin' on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all!""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it poppin', dog

Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow

So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rear view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yeah, my number two on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, tellin' them, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me
I'm 'bout to pull up at your home, and it's on

(Holy shit, hey!)
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna

Knows that she can, but she won't say no

Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

Superstar DJ's, here we go

[Hook: Ciara]
They say - ""He do a little this, he do a little that
He always in trouble,"" and I heard
""He's nuttin but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club,"" and they say
""He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin them drugs,"" and I heard
""He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nuttin' but a thug""

[Verse 1: Smoke]
And they say - I'm a slut, I'm a ho, I'm a freak
I got a different girl everyday of the week
You too smart you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm THIS, they say that I'm THAT
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact!
But you don't be hearin it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes - They're
Nuttin' but liars hatin, and I bet
They wouldn't mind tradin pla-ces
With you by my side in my Mercedes

Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin
So what, that's your cousin, they don't mean nuthin
Her like missin a type of affection you get
You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Fuel to the fire, that supplies your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers
I'm that author of the book, they can judge from the cover
Yes - I, I been to jail
And yes - I'm grindin for real
I'm a positive talkin negative pimp
They hate to see you doin better than them, so!

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part & be buying the bar

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies, we live them lives and  keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns, a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple & swallow it down with
The yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Puff, puff pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my g's
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window, when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own 'cause them niggas there let me smoke for free

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
What's up Mary, how you doing
Mary Jane, stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you ruled my brain
You stole my heart, right from the start
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the 'gar

Premro, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

[Verse 6: MJG]
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this and breath again a whole lot of weed, but
I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J
8Ball and MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Droppin' names)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?

They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees

Oh where, oh where could they be?

Sorrow in my soul, 'cause it seems that wrong

He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside

I don't wanna be a murderer

Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

We're all misunderstood

With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas

They can bend it all they want

I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
60,000 people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing (cussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up
I don't mean no disrespect
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you madder (uh, oh)
I'm sorry
But seeing you mad is so sexy

[Pre-Chorus]
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad

[Verse 2]
Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact
That your attitude excites me
(So exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex
(I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face

Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit.""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career

Please come back home

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween
With candy by the pile, but now
You only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true, all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so

[Intro]
Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 1]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack

Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?

Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires

White-trash version of Shania karaoke

To remind me
To find my own

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into life

[Chorus 2]
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
They're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things
Will never change for us at all

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?"

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
It's been a while since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But Dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love the way she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
She's got a smile that'll make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done)
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there (Man, I swear)
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love
Or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

We missed you on the charts last week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
Now if se-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shi-i-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run would never be over, not at least until we say

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say ""sit down; it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow

First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man

Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later

And uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?

Got me doin' dirty dirt

Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us

So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it—no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to

I look at you with such disdain

The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening
I give the final blow

When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight

[Bridge]
Now I'm on my own side
It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when you're blind
It's better that I see it through your eyes
All these thoughts locked inside
Now you're the first to know

[Chorus]
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight
It ends, when darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight, it ends tonight
It ends tonight

Tonight, inside

[Intro]
Hey! Uh
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it
Listen

[Verse 1]
She grabs the yellow bottle, she likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom, it sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And, she looks like a model, except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother, unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh

[Post-Chorus]
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
Yeah

[Verse 2]
She shuts the room down the way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town, she's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
Hey!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare (Cause a glare)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (I had to stop and stare)
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows

[Post-Chorus]
Now dance
Get it, girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this song one time

[Break]
Ow!

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows

[Part II: I Think She Knows (Interlude)]

[Chorus 1]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh

The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (Stop and stare)
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
And now I walk around without a care (Without a care)
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I
I'm love stoned and I could swear that she knows
I think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh

And you don't have the time

Forget what you're going through

Forget about the truth

Yeah, I met you on Myspace
Now I'm bout to fly you out to my place, in the mornin'

It's 5:30 in the morning, good morning
I'm horny and I'm lonely
I'm touching and rubbing
Call me, call me, you call me, you call me
Called you seven times baby girl don't stall me
I wanna kiss you from your temple to your feet
To the dimples in ya cheek, to the middle of your g-string
Conversation underneath the sheets
You know me, Red Bull like a energy, I'mma freak

[Verse 3: Spectacular]
Baby girl said she love phone sex
Say the sound of my deep voice make her wet
You call me five a.m. on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' bout you with panties no top
Picture this, you say you comin' over
Thirty minutes later you was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met you at the do'
Three seconds in the house and ya panties on the flo'
Kiss you on ya mouth and ya hips on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Now you on the phone like damn I made a mess
Got my hands in my pants man I love phone sex

Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I'm sitting looking out the window like damn
Trying to fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind - when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowing that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been running 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they loving it
I'm liking it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm trying to let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm trying to let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better
Just trying to be like ""yeah, forget it, whatever""
Instead of staring out this glass - looking at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

[Hook: T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doing?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas telling me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm trying man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not popping, and my brain ain't stopping
Thinking who she with? Or where she going? Is she club hopping?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been running through my mind all day - can you feel me
I been trying to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been running through my mind all day  can you feel me

[Hook: Bow Wow]
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together

And correct all my mistakes that I ever did

And I feel awkward as I should

Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place

I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack

Say it right, say it all

You either stand, or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for jokin'
There's a hole in the plan

Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

From my hands I could give you

From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body, I could show you a place God knows
You should know the space is holy

Lil' mama the baddest thing 'round here, she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her, ""This s'posed to be yours"" (ha ha!)
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga n' she went for it
First time I caught her shit, she ain't even kno' how to tho'it back
Now she a animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her, ""I'on't usually do this, I'on't fuck on the first night
Cause after I beat ya baby, I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life!""
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil' bust-it baby, cause she keep it tight

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long

You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown

Lets get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs

And we'll feel so alive

Answers that we'll never find

This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply:

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme whachu got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)

I'm going to make it bend and break

Good times roll, in case God doesn't show

And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
""Who does he think he is?"" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...

While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM we was at the club (what happened?)
2 AM: ten bottles of bub (money ain't a thing)
And 'bout 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 3]
Nigga, could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a Flying Spur
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (speedin'!)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous, livin' in the fast lane (ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'ma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Outro]
You niggas need to stay focused
When you're dealin' with a motherfuckin' G
You know my name, Jones, One Eye, Capo Status
All the above, motherfucka
This Dipset, ByrdGang, we born to fly
Y'all know the rules: fall back or fall back
Someone tell my bitch Summer I'm lookin' for her

When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade...""
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

[Verse 2]
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

[Chorus]
To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Bridge]
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

[Post-Chorus]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care!

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Post-Chorus]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on!)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on!)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on!)
Go and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry on!)
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on...)

This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work

Trying to study our approach

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know, it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

[Verse 2]
Catching wild life from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

[Hook]
While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song

This a number one champion sound
Yeah, Estelle, we 'bout to get down
Who the hottest in the world right now?
Just touched down in London town
Bet they give me a pound
Tell them put the money in my hand right now
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats

[Hook 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

[Verse 1: Estelle]
He said, ""Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya.""
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin
I'm liking this American boy, American boy

Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping, baby, then we'll go to a café
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those Shell Toes
Walking that walk, talk that slick talk
I'm liking this American boy, American boy

Tell 'em wagwan, blud!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Who killing them in the UK?
Everybody going to say ""You, K!""
Reluctantly, because most of this press don't fuck with me
Estelle once said to me, ""Cool down, down
Don't act a fool now, now.""
I always act a fool oww, oww
Ain't nothing new now, now
He crazy, I know what you thinking
Ribena, I know what you're drinking
Rap singer, chain blinger
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinking
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow ‘cause all my clothes designer?
Uh, dressed smart like a London bloke
Before he speak his suit bespoke
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish

[Bridge: Estelle]
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love?
Ooh, would you be my American boy, American boy?

See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

Going, coming
Thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice, you mean everything

Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Verse 2]
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing

All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away-ay-ay
Going away-ay-ay
Going away
Going away-ay-ay
Going away-ay-ay"

She wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy, always tight and never sloppy
And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go again, ridin' through the stormy weather
You better button up, if you wanna go get her
Cause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her
But when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover

Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared, you need to get like me
Stunting is a habit, just gotta have it
Shorty keep throwing that thang at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like
He ain't your type to change your life, but if you did ya homework
Girl, I'm pretty sure you know what I got, drop-tops
And you know Jones and Banner gonna roll, let me stop
Stunting is a habit

Let them bougie boys ride Maybach
I'm in the candy, laid back like I slang crack
My money stacked to the ceilin'
Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin', them 28's on deck
37 on my wrist, a hundred five on my neck
This rap money's okay but you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors (doors), wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose, the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (uh)
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart and DJ Screw in my cup

[Chorus: Yung Joc]
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the, get, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the, get like me

Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air
Stuntin', stuntin' is a habit, put it in the air

I wanna know...

Where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared

[Hook:]
I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out
I remember when I screamed I hated you
But somehow deep inside still loving you
Sad and lonely

No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be
But you made me leave
And plus my heart it just, it just kept telling me so

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
There was nowhere else to go, oh
Nobody else to turn to, no
For the rest of my life, I promised myself I will love me first genuinely

[Hook]

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I gave up loving you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
So sad and lonely, hey
I remember when I stormed out
I remember when I gave up loving you
I was sad and lonely"
36,I'm Yours,"('Jason Mraz',)",['Martin Terefe'],976384,27,2008,"[Verse 1]
Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure

[Post-Chorus]
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
A-do you, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, but do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, hmm

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)
I'm yours, ha!

So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time and you know is gonna be there
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down, who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the highwire

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

[Verse 2]
Out the many broken backdoors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the soul falling down
From the thrones without any innuendos
But you found it a piece for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifters one has a short life

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

I wanna tell you what you do to think you practice what you preach
Now I know there's nothing we can't reach
'Cause the heart can't erase once it finds a place to be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight

If you think you finna get her with a goddamn chain
You insane, boy you better get some goddamn change
She a fool, been to school, even walked across the stage
And she say, ""I love Webbie from his looks to his ways""
The stilettos the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas depend on how the cheddar look

When she break a nigga off, got a nigga spoiled
She a bad lil chick, a fly lil chick
Hit me on my phone, she like to buy that dick

Can you save me from this?

And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take them away

What should matter to me

I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

[Verse 2: Kevin Rudolf]
Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Panties drop, and the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela

And Tamara, ménage à moi
I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock

And I wish I could say the things you do

To be everything that I've been looking for

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)

Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life

I feel like I owe you my life
And as strange as it may seem
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice

That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by
It's not hard to know why
I keep coming back to you

[Chorus: Natasha Bedingfield]
You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Ooh, look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me
Oh, wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this

[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
Mi never find a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
That still make me think about my middle school kiss
I sit here in this chair and I wish
For you not to leave me now (Let's go)
My friends, they always told me
Not to make you my wifey
Man, they was putting you down
And now they see we rolling
Me and you, we strolling
They don't wanna come around

[Chorus until Fade: Natasha Bedingfield]
(Let me hear you say) You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this (Let me hear you say)
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well, this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say

Wrap your world around me

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song

I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better
Reason to write you a love song today

I learned the hard way
That they all say things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and
Your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you asked for it

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

Waited for something to come along

Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

Yeah! Ugh! a fresh cool young Lu'
Trying to cash his microphone check, 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung? You?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you—you come too
And then it hit me—standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool

Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""

Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)

We want it to braid
Meaning, we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage...-uh

And when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

94,You're Gonna Miss This,"('Trace Adkins',)",['Frank Rogers'],7502,93,2008,"[Verse 1]
She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

[Verse 2]
Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down

[Chorus]
Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

[Verse 3]
Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23
Heh... It's hard to believe, but

[Chorus]
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this
Yeah, you're gonna miss this"

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

[Chorus]
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

[Verse 2]
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

[Chorus]
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died

Now to the ballers poppin' bottles with they Henny in they cups
Screamin', ""Money ain't a thang"", if it ain't, throw it up
In the sky (In the sky)
And hold your drinks up high (High)
And to my independent mamas who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model, when them broke fellas holla
Tell 'em, ""Bye"" (Bye)
And hold your drinks up high

You can blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose
Blame it on the 'Trón, got you in the zone

Blame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

13,Crack A Bottle,"('Eminem', 'Dr. Dre', '50 Cent')",['Dr.\xa0Dre'],334050,47,2009,"[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 1: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 2: Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto

Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)

And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday

No regrets, I'm blessed to say

Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take

Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane"

I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

[Verse 2]
Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Yeah, where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on

And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

Now you'll never see
What you've done to me
You can take back your memories
They're no good to me
And here's all your lies
You can't look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well

[Chorus]
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well

When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, but you never tell
(But you never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

I hope that it will give you hell (Give you hell)
You can sing along
I hope that it puts you through hell"

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that

And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you

Could this be the end?
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Verse 2]
I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last, but this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase, but you're chasing your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

[Chorus]
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say...

'Cause I feel the distance
Between us
Could be over with a snap of your finger
Oh, no

Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up

'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight to say goodnight

And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?

If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air?

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise, you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

But, I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah, of course, I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention

Tell everyone it's broken

Waitin' for me to come home

Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin'd up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say (Mmh)
""Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today"" (Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp shit flying high (Flying high)
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky)
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest (Oh)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Hey, oh, it comes around)

Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that, bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying, now I'm crashing

Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson

And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again

I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call
(Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall, until it comes around, hey

And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

Transformed your love into light

Sleep 'til I died a thousand times

And I miss you more and more

Call up my homies
It’s on and poppin tonight cause it’s meant to be ours

S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Verse 1]
A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[Verse 2]
Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (Uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

[Chorus]
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day

2,Airplanes,"('B.o.B', 'Hayley Williams')",['Alex da Kid'],426084,6,2010,"[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro: B.o.B]
I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now

I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby

Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list

And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho

Dunking on his delegates

Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane"

Hey look ma, I made it, hey look ma, I made it

Friends are happy for me or they're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers while these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust, then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

Ain't you ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, Oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Post-Chorus]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Verse 2]
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

[Pre-Bridge]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Bridge]
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls"

High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again

Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Come take my hand (Come take my hand)

Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I’m so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it

Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say hi
And I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go

Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?

[Intro]
Kane is in the building

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first"

This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you it’s catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change

You know why? Cause all the bitches love me
All I need is a beat that's super-bumpin'

Put your arms out front, lean side-to-side
They gonna be on you when they see you hit that Dougie, right
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside

I show my moves off now everybody tryna to do me
I leave the functions and all the ladies tryna to screw me
Now you just do you and I'mma do me
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started boomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

And when that nigga stop they like, Dougie some mo

And brought it to the hood and, got the whole crew cash

Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie

But I'm about to escape with a bitch and head home
She got her friend so it's a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long
She like, you hubby
I think she love me
But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gonna make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
Duh, bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin'"

I know they say ""You can’t go home again""
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Verse 2]
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

I thought that maybe I could find myself

When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

But I can't, let go of what's in front of me here

Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Been here all along, so why can't you see?

You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you

Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna"

Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time

Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair

Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out

[Chorus 2]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Bridge]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus 3]
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level

No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 2]
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

[Chorus]
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right

God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
He gave me you"

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly

Address to places like Abbey Road

We're young enough to say

A good, good life

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that

Listening to you expressin' all them feelings

And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that

Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better"

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever

How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever

How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful

And now you're back

Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me

Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah

I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring

Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback

Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on

Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair

Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard

We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

A sky full of lighters

[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say

And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop

Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches

Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""wine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?

It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks

'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

Appreciate every mixtape your friends make

Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I’m on my way
(Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, you’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried tear drops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped
Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out

Oh, it's so sexy, yo

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)

I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, ok, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck - 'cause they be swallowin' it

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)

To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the ""us"" in ""trust"", baby
Ahh, let's go!

I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

'Til there’s nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away

Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

But it seems we're going

[Chorus]
Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Verse 2}
You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline

I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out

Pulls up, pull out

The day I first met you, you told me
You'd never fall in love
But now that I get you, I know fear is what it really was

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now here we are
So close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize, baby, I'm not like the rest?

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
On Sunday, you went home, alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love, but you did not reply

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live

There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run, whoa, whoa

Don't wanna break your heart (Don't wanna break your heart)
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared, it's wrong)
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
(Let me give your heart a break)

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break

In Romania, she pulled me to the side and told me, ""Pit, you can have me and my sister""
In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb
And in Greece, you've guessed it the women are sweet
Been all around the world, but I ain't gon' lie

I ain't talking credit cards, if you know what I mean

In Columbia the women got everything done, but they some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, they freaky with big ol' boobs and they thongs, blue yellow and green

En New York, tengo la boricua
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera

If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby

Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, ""There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy""
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
And pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for

Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for

She, she ain't real

Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds

Haven't you heard the rumours?

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried

Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa

Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile

Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo

Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's alright
(That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I?

[Chorus 2]
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)

What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?

I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No
When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

[Bridge 2]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

[Outro]
The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh"

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number

And we're, we're just getting started

Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang

About your name on my arm

The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close

If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on)

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself

Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay""

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out

So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.

Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

[Verse 3: Eminem]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? Word, man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out

[Verse 1]
You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you

I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody’s been there
Everybody’s been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out

At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

[Bridge]
Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge 2]
Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

[Outro]
No one's ever gonna stop us now"

I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies

Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life

Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and surviors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Gettin' mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was destined

Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
Cuz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feelin', Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldn't panic

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go..."

Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Verse 1: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Bridge: Nanna, Ragnar]
You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama’s phone started ringing off the hook
I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady
Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together

Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out

Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""

Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

[Verse 2]
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever

And after all this time, I'm still into you

Some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time

I'm into you
Baby not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

Have a night that you'll never forget

Emptied out by a single word

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine

So I put my faith in something unknown

Waiting on you to look my way and scoot

Put in my country right hip-hop mixtape

Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight

Burnt lungs, sour taste

Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat

I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough

Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train

I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it

Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you

It hurts to know you’re happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge: Luke]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[Chorus: All]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Outro: Luke]
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab

All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', ""Come on, he ain’t worth the pain

Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

Bring it ‘til his memory fades away

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me

You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

You used to be thirsty for me (Right)

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up

When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

And let the words fall out

Everybody’s been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing

Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

And let the words fall out

Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?

Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me
When I just wanna make you smile?

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love

Don't fuck with my love

I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold

I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love

Take aim and reload

(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love

I got a missed call from your bitch
She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like girls in the shower, when it's winter fresh
It’s some Twitter pussy, I met on the Internet
On my late-night thirsty, ‘cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'
I keep a stack of hundreds, I can keep a secret
If anything you was explorin', you wasn’t cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho

Oh why, why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl, I guess that must be you

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even

Can't get to me at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

[Chorus 2]
Let it go, let it go
I'm one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on

[Bridge]
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past!

[Chorus 3]
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on

The cold never bothered me anyway"

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""

Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)

That kind of luxe just ain't for us

Come with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl

I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost

I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
Q

[Chorus: Hollis]
Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky

Funny thing about talking behind my back

Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided

So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Bridge]
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries"

Roll it with me and then light that up and the rest is history write that, book
My cheerleader, something about her demeanor
Even though I'm off these margaritas can't none of these hoes here come between us
Shorty no regular chick, so I just take her to places she ain't know exist
So she never forget, who the man is

She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (You bastard)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (You bastard)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe"

And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband

Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman

Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate

I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

Dime si es verdad

Cuéntame
Tu despedida para mí fue dura
Será que te llevó a la luna

Es que yo sin ti, y tú sin mí
Dime quién puede ser feliz
Eso no me gusta

Vivir sin tí, no aguanto mas
Por eso vengo a decirte lo que siento
Estoy sufriendo la soledad

Y aunque tu padre no aprobó esta relación
Yo sigo insistiendo a pedirte perdón
Lo único que importa está en tu corazón

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

I call shots just do it like Nike
No FaceTime, but the people want to Skype me
If I do time, then who would really write me?
I stay on y'all mind but, “Oh, I think they like me”
Clean pair of sneaks with a designer belt
Please watch your step, 'cause I'm feeling myself
Throw a flag on the play, man somebody get the ref
Go, ""Blah la la la low,"" man, somebody get some help
Pulled up on the block

Your whole team rats, your CEO is Master Splinter
'Bout to hit the Quan and turn that girl into a member
Now my whole team flexing, I think we got a winner
People want to dap it up but they can't get none from me
I went to jail and snap it up, at least I had bum money
People wanna walk around me tryna steal my lingo
Just make sure when you talk about me you say he's doing his thing though

Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else

You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone

On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh

I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't

To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ""Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me""

A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discothèque Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm

Just keep your eyes on me""

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, ""Wanna ride out?"", and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

[Bridge]
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

[Chorus 5]
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Went and bought a 911 with my trap money
A million up but still ain't never touch my rap money
I'm out in LA fuckin' with that boy OT
Flew to LA, got a plug on that OG
You know I've been gettin' money if you know me
When I first met my plug, I told him, ""I piss a hundred G's""
I ain't comin' to get it unless you got a hundred piece
I don't want it, fuck it, your price, you need to cut it
Your ice, you need to tuck it, she fuck with me, she lucky
A half a million, all 20s in that Gucci luggage
Let's skip the small talk, it's time to talk numbers
Young nigga playin' with commas, might go get a Lamb for the summer
I've been outchea in these streets all my life hustlin'
My nigga beefin' then I'm beefin', wrong or right I'm bustin'
My traphouse, I love it
Put some Forgis on my old school and I had to gut it
But should I put a roof in?

Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

Are running out of time

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why

""I love you"" ain't no pickup line, so
Always stay humble and kind

And help the next one in line

Realize how much I need you

Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat

Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit

I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit

I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool

I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse

They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words

I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think

When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion

Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog

Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire

Feeling the world go against us

Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look

First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived

Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown

Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened

Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides

Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right

I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life

This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did

I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long

Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

67,Scars To Your Beautiful,"('Alessia Cara',)","['Pop & Oak', 'Sebastian Kole']",1037051,30,2017,"[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me, girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around, it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day

And I'm in my happy place posted
I ain't frowned since '06, I ain't cried since '01

Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me

I know that you'll thank God you did

Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch

Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)

Is it too soon to do this yet?

Tú eres la máquina, la máquina de baile
Si no tiene' a nadie vente pa' mi' brazos, caile
Ese perfume se siente en el aire
Algo como Argentina, tú me traes los Buenos Aires
'Tá poderosa, media escandalosa
Habrán muchas mujeres pero tú eres otra cosa
Si fuera un delito eso de que estás hermosa
Te arresto en mi cama y te pongo las esposas

Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave

Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong

Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
Cause it's still burning

So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast

If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it

Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

From calling to you

But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be

Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?

Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

We push and pull like a magnet do

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes

Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate

The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved

These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)

Drip too hard, caution on the floor

We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch

And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one

Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it

Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

A house, and everything in between

She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now

And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Verse 2]
It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
