0,Ain't No Other Man,"('Christina Aguilera',)",['DJ Premier'],21742,32,2006,"[Intro]
Heeeeey! Yeah
(Do your thang, honey!)

[Verse 1]
I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Somethin' 'bout you caught my eye
Somethin' moved me deep inside
I don't know what you did boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

[Pre-Chorus]
Told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friends
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
That every time I see you, everything starts making sense
(Do your thang, honey!)

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy, a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true (alright)
Ain't no other man but you

[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd be alright (no, no, no)
'Till you came and changed my life (yeah, yeah, yeah)
What was cloudy now is clear (yeah, yeah)
You're the light that I need here
You got what I want boy, and I want it
So keep on giving it up

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell your mother, your brother, your sister and your friends
Tell the others, your lovers, better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine
And no one else's, woah, oh

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you

[Bridge]
Break it down now!
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other (other)
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you
You are there when I'm a mess
You talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test

[Chorus]
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (next to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (oh yeah)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
And now I'm telling you, so ain't no other man but you
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kind of guy a girl finds in a blue moon (baby, baby, no)
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass (don't you know?)
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you"
1,Bad Day,"('Daniel Powter',)","['Mitchell Froom', 'Jeff Dawson']",144462,1,2006,"[Verse 1]
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

[Verse 3]
Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Breakdown]
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you're like
And how does it feel?
One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh ooh, ooh...
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...

[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me, yeah yeah)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Yea, yea, yea, yea, I'm so icy
Charm so heavy that my neck don't like me

I'll throw my chain in the crowd like dang these (this is nothin')
Diamonds is nothin' to me
Especially when I'm dressin' up, its just a button to me (bling)
And not to mention my T's
Cuz they color coordinated, complimentin' the teeth (alright, thanx)
So check out my swag
Diamonds red, white, and blue like the American flag (its so colorful)
And see I got that nice cream
So much money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream
Give you a black eye cause of the beating
They think I am a mutant the way ya boy is beasting
I stay winning some time, you'll call it cheating
And my boys always around like it's a meeting

Is that ya chain?
Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride 'n' let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang
You know the name

Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us

Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you, babe
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

[Hook]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
I want to see your grill (You wanna see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom rows gold)

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do baby, it's the ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth looking something like a disco ball
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

[Hook]
Smile for me daddy (What you looking at)
Let me see ya grill (Let me see my what)
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill (Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill)

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
[Ali]
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em, on the top, on the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
[Gipp]
I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry
Tipping on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry
[Ali]
I got four different sets its a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold
(Had a whole top diamonds and the bottom row's gold)

I can't believe you actually picked me.)

[Intro: Justin's Mother]
(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

[Verse 1]
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

[Hook]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Verse 2]
I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

[Hook]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Bridge]
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

[Hook]
Hate me today

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say ""sit down; it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain

37,"Jesus, Take The Wheel","('Carrie Underwood',)",['Mark Bright'],37284,78,2006,"[Verse 1]
She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

Oh, take it, take it from me

Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world

But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")

But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)

When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I

Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy

You know, I be thinking to myself
We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
We did everything together

Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)

Use to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days
(One wish, one wish, one wish)

(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
If I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good
(One wish)
One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish

[Intro]
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

[Verse 2]
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you

Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor

Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could, I'd relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it

To all the fellaz, know you feel me, you ever had a woman
Good times let the bad times, and you ain't see it comin'
Tried the best to make her happy (happy), but it wasn't enough (it wasn't enough)
Cuz mama told me in relationships the road get rough (road get rough)
And I ain't the one to have my head down, weeping, stressed out
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next route (route), yes
I thought I was a man, guess she ain't understand
And now she sittin' thurr, lookin' crazy like ""damn""

[Hook: Tyrese]
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work
Say we gotta make it work"

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And ride with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twin's steady twistin' like, ""Hit this dough!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down, got to stop pollution
CD changes, niggas like, ""Who is that producin'?""
That's the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'

Holy shit, ‘cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big old Excursion just swervin', all up in the curb'n
A nigga be sippin' on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all!""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it poppin', dog

Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow

That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rear view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yeah, my number two on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, tellin' them, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me
I'm 'bout to pull up at your home, and it's on

(Holy shit, hey!)
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna

Knows that she can, but she won't say no

Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

'Cause I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

They say - ""He do a little this, he do a little that
He always in trouble,"" and I heard
""He's nuttin but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club,"" and they say
""He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin them drugs,"" and I heard

[Verse 1: Smoke]
And they say - I'm a slut, I'm a ho, I'm a freak
I got a different girl everyday of the week
You too smart you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm THIS, they say that I'm THAT
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact!
But you don't be hearin it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes - They're
Nuttin' but liars hatin, and I bet
They wouldn't mind tradin pla-ces
With you by my side in my Mercedes

Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin
So what, that's your cousin, they don't mean nuthin
Her like missin a type of affection you get
You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Fuel to the fire, that supplies your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers
I'm that author of the book, they can judge from the cover
Yes - I, I been to jail
And yes - I'm grindin for real
I'm a positive talkin negative pimp
They hate to see you doin better than them, so!

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part & be buying the bar

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies, we live them lives and  keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns, a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple & swallow it down with
The yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Puff, puff pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my g's
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window, when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own 'cause them niggas there let me smoke for free

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
What's up Mary, how you doing
Mary Jane, stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you ruled my brain
You stole my heart, right from the start
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the 'gar

Premro, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

[Verse 6: MJG]
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this and breath again a whole lot of weed, but
I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J
8Ball and MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Droppin' names)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?

Oh where, oh where could they be?

Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul, 'cause it seems that wrong

He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside

I don't wanna be a murderer

Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

We're all misunderstood

With the world and those who lead it

To rise above and beat it

They can bend it all they want

""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
60,000 people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

90,When You're Mad,"('Ne-Yo',)",['Shea Taylor'],14287,94,2006,"[Verse 1]
It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing (cussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up
I don't mean no disrespect
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you madder (uh, oh)
I'm sorry
But seeing you mad is so sexy

[Pre-Chorus]
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is

[Chorus]
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad

[Verse 2]
Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact
That your attitude excites me
(So exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex
(I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about

[Pre-Chorus]
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure
But one thing that I do know is

[Chorus]
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad"
91,Where'd You Go,"('Fort Minor', 'Holly Brook')",['Mike Shinoda'],100086,43,2006,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit.""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing “Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween
With candy by the pile, but now
You only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing “Where'd you go?”

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true, all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

When you made me that initial batch of songs
I was like, that's the shit, right there

[Intro]
Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 1]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?

This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down

Nothing to lose

My life is brilliant
