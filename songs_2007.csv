Backstroking, sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down

Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

Oh, that I dug my key into the side

Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires

After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be

But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While lookin’ through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were lookin’ for
If there’s one memory I don’t wanna lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room

This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun

If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)

This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left

You know, you know

And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of Hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all, I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up

I need to hear you say
That I love you (I love you)
I loved you all along
And I forgive you (I forgive you)
For being away for far too long

Believe it
Hold on to me, and never let me go

And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
My mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
It's like I'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin' to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man, I'm slippin', can't lose my balance, I'm tryin' not to panic

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back, mane
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it—no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I won't pull through

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough"

Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
Girl, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

[Verse: Keyshia Cole]
If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out, with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see, it all belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
(You said you couldn't get an answer, baby)
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial

Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that

And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you

Yeah, so this is goodbye

Forget what you're going through

Forget about the truth

Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")
Because

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side

Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, ""I do"")

Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)

When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly

I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will

I never read your letter

Give me that Sunday school answer

Never again

Ignorance is bliss

Trying to fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind - when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowing that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been running 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they loving it
I'm liking it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm trying to let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm trying to let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better

I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doing?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas telling me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm trying man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not popping, and my brain ain't stopping
Thinking who she with? Or where she going? Is she club hopping?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you

I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
(Ah, so what you need?)
I’ll need a, a credit card that’s got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I’m gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I’d even cut my hair and change my name

And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars

Hire eight bodyguards that love to beat up assholes

Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack

So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga n' she went for it
First time I caught her shit, she ain't even kno' how to tho'it back
Now she a animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her, ""I'on't usually do this, I'on't fuck on the first night
Cause after I beat ya baby, I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life!""
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil' bust-it baby, cause she keep it tight

Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder

If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat her hunda
Babe snatchin, not now, I'm tellin ya, I promise!

Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"

I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'

I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like ""That's that shit""

Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for

Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

Lets get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs

And we'll feel so alive

Ridin’ all day hustlin’, all for the cake man

First they made cheap Ray-Ban like a felon
I’m growin’ up now spittin’ hotter than Mohellans
I’m a steal every girl ever gon’ to fly
I’m a young little dude, stay runnin’ from cops
And Marrero is the place where I got my props

This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)

They love how I move crowds from side-to-side

This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme whachu got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean

This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""

(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll...)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
""Who does he think he is?"" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...

[Chorus]
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
""He tastes like you
Only sweeter""
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
""See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter""

Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal
Ball...
It's always cloudy except for (Except for...)
When you look into the past (Look into the past...)
One night stand...
One night stand off!

[Chorus]
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
""He tastes like you
Only sweeter""
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
""See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter""

[Bridge]
They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
""He tastes like you
Only sweeter,"" whoa
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
""See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter""
One night and one more time (One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
""He tastes like you
Only sweeter""
One night and one more time (One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories

Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

How can you walk away? Everything stays the same

Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me

To rise above and beat it

They can bend it all they want

Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1]
Ya boy gettin' paper (money), I buy big cars (foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (choose one!)
Stay sky high, twisted, fly with the stars (twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (do it!)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistenin' (ballin'!)
But I spent 'bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (what else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!""

I made the whip get naked (what happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM we was at the club (what happened?)
2 AM: ten bottles of bub (money ain't a thing)
And 'bout 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

Nigga, could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a Flying Spur
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (speedin'!)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous, livin' in the fast lane (ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'ma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (let's do it!)

Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are

Just a boy, who had to sing this song

I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

[Chorus]
When someone said count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever
And ever, who knew?

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?

[Chorus]
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and

[Outro]
That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
And time makes it harder, I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep
My darling, who knew?
My darling, my darling, who knew?
My darling, I miss you
My darling, who knew?
Who knew?"
94,Wind It Up,"('Gwen Stefani',)",['The Neptunes'],8342,83,2007,"[Intro]
High on the hills with the lonely goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-lay-he-hoo
He yodelled back with the girl and goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-low

[Chorus]
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodellay, yodallay, yodel-low (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?)
They like the way we react every time we hear the...

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

[Chorus]
Wind it up
Wind it up (C'mon)
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low

[Verse 2]
You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

[Chorus]
Wind it up (Whenever you're ready)
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low

[Bridge]
(Uh-huh) this is your moment
(Uh-huh) come on girl, you know you own it
(Uh-huh) you know your key is still tick-tocking
(Hell yeah) but you know they're watching
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
To the front, to the side, to the back, but don't let him ride
Keep going girl, it's your night
Don't let him steal your light
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff
But does he know how to wind you up? (C'mon)

[Chorus]
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodelay, hey!"
